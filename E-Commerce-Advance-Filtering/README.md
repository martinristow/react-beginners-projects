# üßæ E-Commerce-Advance-Filtering

E-Commerce-Advance-Filtering is an e-commerce platform that offers advanced product filtering options.
The project allows users to filter products based on categories such as price, color, and brand (Nike, Adidas, Puma,
etc.).
The platform is built using React, and its filtering system provides a seamless experience for users who want to quickly
find the products they are looking for.

## üöÄ Features
- **Product Filtering**
    - **Price**: Filter products by price range (e.g., $0 - $50, $50 - $100, $100 - $150, Over $150).
    - **Categories**: Filter by product category (e.g., Sneakers, Flats, Sandals, Heels).
    - **Colors**: Filter by color options (e.g., Black, Blue, Red, Green, White).

- **Responsive Design**
  - The app is not responsive at the moment and needs further development to support responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

- **Interactive Filters**
  - The filters dynamically update the displayed products as users select different options for price, category, or color.

## Technologies Used
 - **React**: For building the dynamic user interface.
 - **CSS**: For styling the components (not fully responsive yet).
