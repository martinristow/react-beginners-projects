# Hidden Search Bar

A simple, interactive hidden search bar component built using React. This component toggles a search input field when
the search icon is clicked and hides it again when clicked outside the input area.

## Features

- **Search Icon**: Initially displays a search icon (`FaSearch` from `react-icons`).
- **Search Input Toggle**: Clicking on the icon reveals the search input field, and clicking outside the input field
  hides it again.
- **Background Color Change**: The background color changes based on the visibility of the input field.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Icons**: A library for using icons in React applications.
- **CSS**: Custom styles to manage the look and feel of the component.
